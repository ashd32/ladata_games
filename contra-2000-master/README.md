# Contra 2000

Here I was playing around with an Online Multiplayer game. The idea was multiplayer contra. Like the NES classic....with this spin: everybody would hop into the same level, play as the contra guy, and try to shoot each other.

These are the things I was wanting to try out ...

* MelonJS - a framework for browser games (two thumbs up)
* Spring 5 and Pivotal Reactor - server to handle the client connections (two more thumbs up)
* Let my 7 year old help...he's been begging me to learn...and I think he might of learned a thing or two.

I havent worked on this for a few months...so Im calling it done for now. Hopefully somebody can make use of the source code. 
Here are a couple videos.

# Notes

I hosted this thing on a free AWS box.
The performance was pretty solid...got several players playing together and it didnt lag...the bullets hit well.
